# OpenGL-2D-Game
This is a game coded with C++ and openGL language.
We named it as “Snake Game” which is very easy to play.
This game is a classic representation of the snake game that appears in most of the leading mobile like Nokia.
The objective of this game is to move the snake or turn the direction of the snake by ninety degrees to eat as many food blocks.
There is only one food block at any given time. 
When the food is eaten, the snake grows in length and one point will be added to the score board. 
If the snake hits any edges of the screen the game is over. Then the score board will get displayed.  
Here we avoid one of the contents in the usual snake game which is “when the snake hits itself the game is over”
But in our modified game the game gets over only “when the snake hits any edges of the screen”.
The reason for this modification is to encourage the users to play this game more and more. 
Because when every food is eaten the snake grows in length therefore it took difficult for a user to manage the snake to not to hit itself. So, we thought this modification will be very easily handled by the children which is the most important age group we should cover when it comes as gaming. 
In our game the snake head is denoted by red color and the body of the snake is denoted by the blue color.
The food block of the game is denoted by green color box and the edges of the screen are colored with red color squares.
